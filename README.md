## About:
**K1L0B0T** is a bot I designed to further develop my javascript/ typescript abilities. This bot is capable of joining multiple server allowing them to each
have their own configurations. The bot is still very new right now and if you invite it to you server expect frequent updates. This is also 100% open source so feel free to deploy it yourself!

### Features:
- New World Game Timers (Example: Asmodemun, Glitterying Ebony, Phoenixweave, Runic Leather)
- Basic Moderation Commands (Example: ban, unban, kick, votekick, clear)

### Planned Features:
- Logging System
- Auto Moderation
- Reaction Roles
- Economy
- Ticket System
